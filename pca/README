	I trust this project will appear straightforward. It uses svm, particularly the iris dataset, testing it as it moves from dim. 4 to dim. 3.

	I've printed the transformation of the first five data points from both training and testing for comparison.

	*Note on color scheme:*
	Yellow - # of support vectors chosen.
	Red - Incorrect
	Blue - Correct "-1"
	Green - Correct "1"
